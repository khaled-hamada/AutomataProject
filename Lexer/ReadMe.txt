Lexical Anaylsis using Java -- Automata 

This Project is mainly for my 4th year CSE course Automata Theory.
This is the first phase of the compiler design which is lexical analysis
The lexer, also called lexical analyzer or tokenizer,
is a program that breaks down the input source code into a sequence
of lexemes. It reads the input source code character by character,
recognizes 
the lexemes and outputs a sequence of tokens describing the lexemes 

This project is based on this great series of articles :

In the serires the author is buliding a compiler for 
a programming language called "Blink" using JavaScript 
, but i edited the project and build it using "JAVA" and also edit 
the programing language and build something like C programming language 
But Not c itself
